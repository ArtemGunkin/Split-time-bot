    *Everything is simple here, but read carefully.*

    You have three available standard timers: 5, 15 и 25 minutes. The timers can be changed in the settings. Use them for short-term tasks.

    Also you can use Sprint - Pomodoro similarity. Again, the time of work, rest and the number of pieces you can change the settings.

    *And why all this is necessary?*
    This thing is for those who have all the time distracted from working and by the end of the day realize that nothing really did. This is not about you? Then you do not need this bot. And if you know yourself - read more.

    *How to use?*
    Run Sprint and work. After the end of the each interval, I will notify you and put the timer for relax. But you can ignore or completely forget about the task, it is necessary to fix. Therefore, it is necessary to leave a review (press the button) after each interval.

    *What are the reviews?*
    In the evening look Statistics. If you are too often distracted or completely forget about the problem, you need to reduce the time and to increase the rest. As soon as the statistics start to improve, increase work time. So you'll be more productive.
